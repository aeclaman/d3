          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks & Age, Income, Poverty</h2>
          <p>When looking at Median Household Income and smoking, there is a trend that lower income households appear
            to have a highter percentage of smokers, although some outliers do exist. Further, comparing Median Household
            Income with obesity, a similar trend can be seen. Lower income households appear to have highter percentages
            of obesity. However, the trend does flatten out a bit when comparing Median Household Income with low healthcare
            coverage. Less correlation can be seen here with some definite outliers.
          </p>

          <p>When looking at Median Household Age and smoking, there doesn't appear to be any trend. The data suggests most
            household's average ages are mid-thirties to early-forties. The households with a higher percentage of smokers seem
            to occur in more southern states. With a similar, non-trending distribution, southern states also seem to have
            higher percentages of homes with obesity health issues. Finally, when we look at Median household age and low healthcare
            coverage, there is a slight trend with older aged households having lower healthcare coverage.
          </p>

          <p>When looking at Percentage of households at the poverty level and smoking, we find that there is a slight upward trend
            in percentage of smokers as poverty levels go up. A little less of an upward trend, with more outliers, can be seen when
            looking at the more poverty stricken households and obesity levels. Finally, the household poverty levels and lack of 
            healthcare coverage does seem more flat as would be expected.
